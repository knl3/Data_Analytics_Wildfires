# Wildfires in Oregon
This project was written for a class, Programming for Data Analytics, I took while studying abroad at the University of Technology Sydney. 

Project grade: A

The primary focus of this project is wildfires in Oregon, USA which is where I call home. This project is aimed to educate the audience on wildfires by expressing the correlation between wildfires and its causes using Pandas, Dataframes, NumPy, Seaborn and MatPlotLib.
